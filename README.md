# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions written in C# - they are not necessarily the optimal solutions, nor are they necessarily particularly well written, as long as they give the correct answer, they're good enough for me. I am solving every day with as minimal help as possible, but am not necessarily going for the fastest times.

I am not including my puzzle input with the solutions, as they should work with anyone's (it looks for it in files named `input01.txt` and onwards in the same folder as the .cs source files).
